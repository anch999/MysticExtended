# MysticExtended
This is an auto mystic enchant rolling addon.
What it does is adds a new window attached to the side of the ascension enchanting window it lets you create lists of mystic enchants that you would like or these lists can also be set to ignore enchants when rolling.
Once it is running it is all automatic as long as you have runes and items on the roll list in the settings.
You can also just make it roll by enchant quality or by list or by all 3.
There is an option per list that will let it auto extract found enchants and remove them from the list and then keep going.
If list, ignore list and quality are all selected it will check them in that order.
To add an enchant to a list just alt click the enchants from the alter window or you can also alt click items in your inventory with enchants to say put them on a don't roll/ignore list.
Left clicking on the Start Reforge buttons will start rolling Right clicking on the Reforge buttons gives you a drop down menu to set what options are being rolled for.
Right clicking on an enchant in a list will remove it from the list shift click will link the enchant.
